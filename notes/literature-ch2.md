## Literature Review
# Ch. 3: Drilling and air quality

This note summarizes literature relevant to Ch. 3 of my dissertation, which examines the effect of oil and gas preproduction and production on ambient air quality in California. Below, I summarize relevant literature. The papers are organized by topic. Papers may appear under multiple topic sub-headings, if applicable.

### Community-based studies
- Arbelaez and Baizel (2015):
  - Arbelaez and Baizel (2015): used a FLIR Gas FindIR camera to observe emissions from well sites in the Lost Hills oil field (Kern Couonty) and the Upper Ojai [is this a field?[] (Ventura County). The investigators observed vapors being emitted from well sites, including active and abandoned wells. Indicates emissions of VOCs
  - In a survey of 27 residents of Lost Hills, a community in Kern County in close proximity to the Lost Hills Oil Field (one of the most productive oil fields in the state, see Data Explo: Production), residents reported regularly smelling odors, with 80% of respondents reporting smelling odors daily (described as petroleum, burning oil, rotten eggs, chemicals, chlorine/bleach, sweet smell, sewage, ammonia)
  - Northwesterly wind in Lost Hills blows pollutants towards residences
  - All samples in Upper Ojai revealed the presence of methane, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, and isoprene. Samples also revealed the presence of ethanol, acetone, n-Heptane, toluene, n-Hexane, n-Nonane, alpha-Pinene, propane, isobutene, n-Butane, n- Pentane, acetaldehyde, trimethylsilanol, n-Nonanal, and an unidentified siloxane.
All samples in Lost Hills
revealed the presence of methane,
dichlorodifluoromethane, and
trichlorofluoromethane. Samples
also
revealed the presence of ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, acetaldehyde, and trimethylsilanol. Most of these compounds are byproducts of hydrocarbon production.
Samples in Lost Hills also revealed the presence of dodecane (C12H26), decalin (C10H18), a tetramethylbenzene isomer, 1-methyldecalin (C11H20), didichlohexyl (C12H22), 1-trydecyne (C13H24)

- Buonocore et al. (2020). Air Monitoring Stations Far Removed from Drilling Activities do not Represent Residential Exposures to Marcellus Shale Air Pollutants. Response to the Paper by Hess et al. on Proximity-Based Unconventional Natural Gas Exposure Metrics.
  - Critical response to recently published study by Hess et al. (2019)
  - Provides helpful commentary on elements that would aid in internal validity of air quality analysis
  - Add SO2 to the analysis
  - Incorporate meteorology, other sources

### Price of oil and production
- The U.S., as a non-OPEC country, is a price-taker (though I wonder if this may have changed now that the U.S. is a leading oil producer?) (Ringlund et al. 2008); consequently, the causal arrow should point from price -> production, and not the reverse.
- Maintaining production at developed fields/wells is relatively inexpensive and production typically unresponsive to oil price changes (Baumeister and Kilian 2016, Ringlund et al. 2008)
- With oil price changes (sustained for at least ~6 months), investments in drilling new wells may be affected; therefore, the effect of price is likely to affect preproduction (Anderson et al. 2014, Baumeister and Kilian 2016). So, revising the above, my working hypothesis is that the causal arrow goes price -> preproduction (-> lagged production?).
- I could look into the effect of price on drilling and production in the data  we haveâ€”do you think that's a good use of my time? This could help establish whether oil price is a good instrument for the preproduction bit, at least
